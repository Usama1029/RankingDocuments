Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way
 that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology gained popularity with the
 rise of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies.
Each block in a blockchain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the 
blockchain, a record of that transaction is transaction  added to every participant's ledger. This decentralization makes 
blockchain secure and transparent, as there is no single point of failure or control.
Industries such as finance, healthcare, supply chain, and even government are exploring blockchain to enhance security, increase efficiency, and ensure data integrity. The future of blockchain technology holds immense potential for transforming traditional business models.
